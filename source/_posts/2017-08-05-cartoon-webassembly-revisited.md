description: Jumpstart your WebAssembly skills with Lin Clark's illustrated crash course.

One of the most concise WebAssembly learning resources out there is Lin Clark's WebAssembly cartoons.

If you're looking at getting started but aren't sure where to turn, you could do worse than to spend some time going through Clark's cartoon articles (carticles?).

Intro to WebAssembly
--------------------

The series started with the five part [Intro to WebAssembly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/) series, which covered:

Background:
* [A crash course in just-in-time (JIT) compilers](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-just-in-time-jit-compilers/)
* [A crash course in assembly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-assembly/)

WebAssembly, the present:
* [Creating and working with WebAssembly modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/creating-and-working-with-webassembly-modules/)
* [What makes WebAssembly fast?](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/what-makes-webassembly-fast/)

WebAssembly, the future:
* [Where is WebAssembly now and what’s next?](https://hacks.mozilla.org/?p=30522)

Using WebAssembly
-----------------

The next series of code cartoons (codetoons?) focuses on more advanced features and goes in-depth into imports and memory.


* [Creating a WebAssembly module instance with JavaScript](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/07/creating-a-webassembly-module-instance-with-javascript/)
* [Memory in WebAssembly (and why it’s safer than you think)](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/07/memory-in-webassembly-and-why-its-safer-than-you-think/)
* [WebAssembly table imports… what are they?](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/07/webassembly-table-imports-what-are-they/)
